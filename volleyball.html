<h4 style="font-size: 18px;">The most winningest MIVA teams during in-conference play</h4>
  <em>These charts display win percentages and rankings for in-conference play for the Men's Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. The ranking of each team is based on who has the higher win percentage, which is derived from their win-loss record as of March 11, 2016. It's important to note that while IPFW has not won a single match against a conference team, it has won 7 matches against non-conference teams. These charts are meant to show how these conference teams match up against each other during conference play.</em>
